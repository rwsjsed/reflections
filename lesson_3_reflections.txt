When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To back up the work.  To have the work in a place other people can reach it. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

you can better control when changes are pulled on top of your current code, there could be a need to merge which gives rise to merge conflicts.  You might want to move any changes you have to another branch before pulling etc
