a .git file show up, but no commit is made... must commit stuff when ready

it allows you to make commits with only the files that you specify, enabling you to break commits up into multiple parts if needed.


git config --global core.editor "'/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl' -n -w"

Only place the files that are logically part of a change into the staging area.

exploring new features.  managing different releases or major versions.  branches targeting different platforms.

diagrams indicate where the branchs diverge, and what the commit history of a given branch is.

the result is the the tail file of the branch that was merged into has the changes from both branches.  Also the history has commits from both branches. 

it strikes me that any degree of automatic mergeing comes with some danger and that it would be good if there was a flag to make it so all conflicts would be looked at manually.
